# Affine Cipher Encryption

This Python script performs Affine cipher encryption on a given plaintext message using user-defined values for 'a' and 'b'.

## Features

- Encrypts plaintext messages using the Affine cipher with user-defined values for 'a' and 'b'.
- Supports uppercase letters.
- Preserves spaces in the input message.

## Usage

1. Modify the `plaintext`, `a`, and `b` variables with the message and encryption parameters you want to use.

2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

3. The script will perform the encryption and print the ciphertext.

## Example

Suppose you have the following lines of code in your script:

```python
plaintext = 'SELAMAT DATANG DI KELAS KRIPTOGRAFI'
a = 17
b = 3
```

After running the script, you will see the following output:

```
TUSXSE UXSUSR US XUFVT LXWXSUSTR
```
